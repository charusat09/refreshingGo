# refreshingGo

I got very good amount of free time available in this last weekend which provide me to refreshing my Go understanding from this wonderful Go introductory video by FreeCodeCamp and  Michael Van Sickle. I am really thankful them for such great tutorial. I completed all 7 hours and provided souce code for the same here. Please feel free to correct the code or add new to it.
